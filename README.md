## Features

- Backup your most recent theater file
- Backup the dll used.
- Backup the map used.
- Generates a text file containing the current version number of the game, as well as the date and time the theater file was created.

## How it Works

It finds the most theater file and reads the name of the file to determine which map the file belongs to.
It then searches for the corresponding map, then the dll for that game and finally it finds your MCC-Win64-Shipping.exe
and generates a text file with the version number of the game as well as the creation date of the film file.
